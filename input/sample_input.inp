# In Sample Case #1, using the generation method, the generated string S is `aapxjdnrbtvldptfzbbdbbzxtndrvjblnzjfpvhdhhpxjdnrbt`.
# Scrambled or original occurences of dictionary words are highlighted as follows:
# - `axpaj` occurs in its scrambled form as `aapxjdnrbtvldptfzbbdbbzxtndrvjblnzjfpvhdhhpxjdnrbt`.
# - `apxaj` occurs in its scrambled form as `aapxjdnrbtvldptfzbbdbbzxtndrvjblnzjfpvhdhhpxjdnrbt`.
#     - Note that even though `apxaj` is the scrambled form of another dictionary word `axpaj`, both should be counted.
# - `dnrbt` occurs twice in its original form as `aapxjdnrbtvldptfzbbdbbzxtndrvjblnzjfpvhdhhpxjdnrbt`, though it should be counted only once.
# - `pjxdn` occurs in its scrambled form as `aapxjdnrbtvldptfzbbdbbzxtndrvjblnzjfpvhdhhpxjdnrbt`.
#     - Note this occurence overlaps with occurence of another dictionary word, but still they're counted independently.
